AutoVRCCam
by Jar

Use this prefab to line up the perfect thumbnail image for your world or avatar before you build and publish your content.
Just place the Auto VRCCam prefab in your scene. When selected, it shows a "Camera Preview" in the Scene window.
Just leave the prefab in your scene and you can re-use that camera angle every time you publish.

Note: This prefab is set up by default for avatars. To zoom the camera, change the project "Size" in the inspector. For worlds, you probably want to change the camera Projection from Orthographic -> Perspective.
