üí° VRC Lighting Demo
=================

This project is an example Unity project that shows an example configuration for lighting a simple [VRChat](https://vrchat.com/) World which contains both some real time and baked lighting.

It also contains demos for turning a light on and off using both Udon (graph) and Udon Sharp, updating reflection probes and controlling the position of the sun.

It is setup with standard clean Post Processing profile created by Silent and built using the [VRWorldToolkit](https://github.com/oneVR/VRWorldToolkit). This is not included by can be downloaded and added from that GitHub repository.

All included models, textures and sounds are either created by me or from CC0 assets on https://ambientcg.com/ and https://freesound.org/.
